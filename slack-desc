opensc: OpenSC (SmartCard utilities with support for PKCS#11 and PKCS#15)
opensc:
opensc: OpenSC provides a set of libraries and utilities to work with smart
opensc: cards.  Its main focus is on cards that support cryptographic
opensc: operations, and facilitate their use in security applications such
opensc: as authentication, mail encryption and digital signatures.  OpenSC
opensc: implements the  PKCS#11 API so applications supporting this API
opensc: (such as Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird) can use it.  On the card
opensc: OpenSC implements the PKCS#15 standard and aims to be compatible
opensc: with every software/card that does so, too.
